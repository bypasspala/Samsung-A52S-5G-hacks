# Samsung-A52S-bloatware-remove
Just some things to make the phone better and rid of some annoying bloatwares.


1.) Download the latest ADB (Android Debug Bridge) from here: https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip


2.) Download the Samsung Android USB driver from here: https://developer.samsung.com/android-usb-driver


3.) Enable the Developer mode on you mobile phone and enable the USB debugging mode (***change the screen timeout to 10 minutes, because the adb shell will not work and you are not able to execute commands when the screen is locked***).

  
4.) Connect your phone to the computer via USB cable (***I have suffered a lot with a faulty USB cable. Sometimes just enought to change a better quality one***).


5.) Open a terminal in you windows system and find the platform tool directory.

For example:
> D:\Samsung>cd platform-tools
