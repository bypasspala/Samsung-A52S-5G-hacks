# Samsung-A52S-bloatware-remove
Just some things to make the phone better and rid of some annoying bloatwares.


1.) Download the latest ADB (Android Debug Bridge) from here: https://dl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools-latest-windows.zip

2.) Download the Samsung Android USB driver from here: https://developer.samsung.com/android-usb-driver

3.) Enable the Developer mode on you mobile phone and enable the USB debugging mode.
    Usefull advice: Change the screen timeout to 10 minutes, because the adb shell will not work and you are not able to execute commands when the screen is locked.
  
4.) Connect your phone to the computer via USB cable.
    Usefull advice: I have suffered a lot with a faulty USB cable. Sometimes just enought to change a better one.
